If `leavesOnly` is true, only nodes that do not depend on any other nodes will be returned in the array.\r\n - `dependantsOf(name, leavesOnly)` - get an array containing the nodes that depend on the specified node (transitively). If `leavesOnly` is true, only nodes that do not have any dependants will be returned in the array.\r\n - `overallOrder(leavesOnly)` - construct the overall processing order for the dependency graph. If `leavesOnly` is true, only nodes that do not depend on any other nodes will be returned.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n    var DepGraph = require('dependency-graph').DepGraph;\r\n\r\n    var graph = new DepGraph();\r\n    graph.addNode('a');\r\n    graph.addNode('b');\r\n    graph.addNode('c');\r\n\r\n    graph.addDependency('a', 'b');\r\n    graph.addDependency('b', 'c');\r\n\r\n    graph.dependenciesOf('a'); // ['c', 'b']\r\n    graph.dependenciesOf('b'); // ['c']\r\n    graph.dependantsOf('c'); // ['a', 'b']\r\n\r\n    graph.overallOrder(); // ['c', 'b', 'a']\r\n    graph.overallOrder(true); // ['c']","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
